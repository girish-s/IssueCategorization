It has been updated to iOS 7 (which was done when iOS 7 was released). The problem is that the phone has not received the Unlocking Phoneg settings from Optus. | I gave the phone to a friend who was travelling to Brazil  and they were unable to use it over there. I went to the extent of mailing a pre-paid Optus SIM to them  and that is the only one that works. It did not work with any Brazilian SIM  and it also does not work with their Vodafone sim (of course  they had to bring the phone back). | No worries I can help with this  | Once the mobile was upgraded to ios7 did you click on back up and restore as well .  | My friend tried to do a back up and restore  which didn't work. I cleared the phone before he went to Brazil  and am fairly sure I did a backup prior to that. | Is the handset with you now ? | Yes. It is connected to the laptop I'm using and iTunes is open | Great  | Now please ,Unlocking Phone

Do you wish to continue with the service? | Can I suspend it for now. I can not afford it at the moment. Or is it easier to cancel and get a new contract later? | We can suspend it but you get charged for $5.50 suspension fee monthly.

Was your old sim card activated with any number at all?  | yes  that it what I mean. | i had a iphone 4s  with a larger sim | The reason why I asked is because I'm afraid the systems won't allow us to activate a sim card with an existing number on it  it has to be a new blank type of sim card.  | Let's try to check on your sim card. | Can you give me the sim card no?  | **no.? | which one? | the old sim? | The one that you would like to activate.  | Yes please  thank you.  | 53XXX-XXX-XXXX | this was the one i had in my old iphone | May I ask for y,Handset Broken

The phone is used by my pensioner mum. We just bought her an Aldi smart phone as the old phone's buttons were too small. What inexpensive plan can you offer me? | Do you already have a mobile number with us?  | yes. 0421 540 244 | I also need to upgrade my bradband as we almost reached limit in December. | Could I please get your full name and date of birth please?  | Kirra Zhigunov 28.3.72 | Thanks Kirra  are you wanting to only change the plan?  | yes. | The lowest plan we have is $20.00. This would cover you for $200.00 of included value for calls and text and you also get 200mb of data  | Yes. I think that is ok. Is it a month to month? I would like to see how she goes with the new phone. | It is a month to month plan | I also need to let you know as the current plan you are on is a old plan that we no longer offer you wouldn't be able to change back to your old plan | So if it is not enoug,Upgrade Plan
